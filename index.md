# 🧙‍♂️  Hi there, <br/> I'm Jordan Knox

### A guy who likes tinkering with tech, building fun things, and continually trying to learn cool new things! 

### Currently, I oversee Cloud Engineering and Advanced Analytics/AI at [TRKKN](https://www.trkkn.com/), a Cloud and Analytics company. 

<br>

I usually tinker on different projects in my spare time - see below for what I'm currently working on!
