# 🧙‍♂️  Hi there, <br/> I'm Jordan Knox

### I'm a guy who loves data and keeps falling into things like Data Engineering and DevOps. I have no clue what I'm doing. 

### Currently, I help build and consult with my other unicorns at [Digitas](https://www.digitas.com/en-us), a global marketing agency. 

<br>

I'm on a journey to get better in tech overall so you can usually find me stumbling through the next project to learn something new
