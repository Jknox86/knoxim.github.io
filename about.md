### Where I live

I'm lucky to live in what I consider the best city around - NYC. I currently reside in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. 

### What I do now

Currently, I help build out global data solutions for ðŸ¦„ [**Digitas**](https://www.digitas.com/en-us), a global marketing agency

### Where I like to do when I'm not lost in documentation 

I love to DM for several groups in Brooklyn where we play a ton of different TTRPG's. I also am a, somewhat, competitive strongman so you can find me training at my local gym - [**S&S**](https://squatsandscience.com/)
